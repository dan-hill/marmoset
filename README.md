Introduction {#mainpage}
============

Marmoset is a micro HTTP server and application framework written in pure C. Marmoset is
is meant for use in embedded devices where full memory and processing requirements must be
kept very low and full HTTP server functionality may not be required or desired while still
providing the development and compatibility advantages of supporting the HTTP protocol standard.

Why use Marmoset?
-----------------
* Marmoset is simple by design. Unlike most of web servers, we have kept the feature set small and
tight in order to allow developers to choose exactly what they need for their application and what
resources they can spare for their particular platform.

* Marmoset is free and open. Marmoset is released under the MIT license, which means it is free
to copy, modify, and use as long as the license is included with any copies. We believe in community
collaboration and support for software this project only lives by participation of other developers.
